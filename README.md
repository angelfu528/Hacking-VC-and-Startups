# Hacking-VC-and-Startups

### Intro
This is a project for my Foundation of Data Analysis class. I chose to look into the trends in the Venture Capital and Startups sector as the topic of this project. 

VC and startups have always been a hot topic in the valley, and the community itself has changed tremendously over the past few decades. From this project, I have learned more about how the community has changed and what led to these changes.
