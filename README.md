# Hacking-VC-and-Startups

This is a project that I completed when I took my Foundation of Data Analysis class. As VCs and startups have 
always been a popular topic in Silicon Valley, I decided to look into some trends in this sector for this project. I studied
the trends in Angel Investors and VCs based on the sectors as well as stages they invested in and their investment amount. I also looked at the exits in terms of average volume and value to see if there's a truly another dot.com bubble as people anticipated. In this project, I mainly used R to perform my analysis.
